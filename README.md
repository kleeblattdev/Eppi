## The challenge

The fist task was to visualize the provided data.json file to a sortale table/list of entries.

The second task was to create a simple form
The user should be able to visualize the provided data.json file to a sortable table/list of entries.


## My Process
1. Created a wireframe on paper
2. Looked at the libraries that were recommended and decided which technologies I want to use
3. Project set up with Vite + TypeScript
4. coded along to the TanStack Table tutorial
5. shadcn/ui set up
6. hard coded the sign up form
7. built a formSchema for the sign up form
8. added some styling with tailwind 
9. Fixing errors for deployment

along the process I tried to comment my code and commit after completing a task.

### Built with
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

### What I learned

In the process of completing the Eppendorf Frontend Challenge, I gained valuable insights and skills that enriched my development journey. Here are the key lessons I learned:

Setting up a project with TypeScript was a smooth process, thanks to the extensive documentation and tools available. TypeScript provided strong type-checking and improved code quality. 

Integrating third party libraries into the project was a rewarding experience.
Understanding the library documentation and utilizing the provided APIs enabled me to implement complex functionalities efficiently.

During the implementation of the sign-up form, I encountered the need for form validation. Although I have yet to complete this aspect, I learned the significance of validating user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience. I look forward to refining this functionality in the future.

Throughout the development process, I practiced writing meaningful comments in the codebase, making it more maintainable and understandable for other developers. Additionally, I adopted a disciplined approach to version control, making frequent commits after completing each task. This practice helped me track changes effectively and revert to previous states if needed.

Overall, the Eppendorf Frontend Challenge provided me with valuable hands-on experience, reinforcing my understanding of frontend technologies and empowering me to tackle more complex projects in the future. I am excited to continue my journey as a frontend developer and explore new opportunities to expand my skill set further.
